This is a basic to-do list app in which the user can add or remove 'to-do' list items and mark their completion.

This project was built with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and used [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to make requests to a fake REST api to simulate database manipulation.
