This is a basic to-do list app in which the user can add or remove 'to-do' list items.

This project was built using react and used jsonplaceholder to make requests to a fake REST api to simulate database manipulation.




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
